IoT container for Raspberry Pi that handles door opening and luminosity. 
For storing event data, it consumes [IoT server](https://github.com/mmontes11/iot-server) REST API via [IoT client](https://github.com/mmontes11/iot-client).

### Features

* Detect door opening and turn on the light if it's dark.
* Detect door closing and and turn off the light.
* Poll luminosity and turn of the light if it's dark and the door is opened.
* Create events in [IoT server](https://github.com/mmontes11/iot-server) via via [IoT client](https://github.com/mmontes11/iot-client).  

### Components

* [Door Magnetic Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/375)
* [LDR](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
* 0.1uF Capacitor
* 4 x 220Î© Resistor
* 4 x LED
